* Connector Types
** Microsoft Windows Event Log - Unified
   - *NOTE*: Notes taken based off SmartConnector version 7.3.0 x64
   - *NOTE*: AD Query User has to be Domain Admin? It appears that it
             does to be able to query Domain Controllers. Tested with using a
             normal user vs domain admin. The Domain Admin could query the
             Domain Controller but the normal user couldn't. There is probably
             a group policy to modify this.
   - *NOTE*: During testing, I've discovered that the polling period
     is approximately 2 minutes. So every 2 minutes, I got an input of
     new logs from the WUC. (Give or take 15 seconds)
*** Description
    The Windows Unified Connector queries an Domain Controller or Global Catalog (don't know) to firstly find Authenticated Windows Computers and then can retrieve logs (category can be defined) from these computers (selection available)

    - No Logs Coming Through
      - Tried wevtutil sl security command
      - Tried wecutil qc

    - *Solution*: I had forgotten to promote the ad account to domain
      admin, so I was just using a normal user account (Domain user)
      for the queries. After adding the user that I specified during
      the connector setup (Active Directory User) to the Domain Admin
      group, I started to see event logs coming through.
      
    - *NOTE*: Confirmed with testing, I created a domain user, and
      tried but it could not connect to retrieve logs. After adding
      that user to the *Domain Admins* group, it worked fine.
      
    - *SOLUTION!!!*: I managed to find a working solution thanks to a pdf from HP Protect: *HPE_Security_ArcSight_Collecting_Windows_Event_Logs.pdf*
      - Create a new GPO which will be applied to the target computers that you want to be able to have their logs read
      - There is only 1 Group Policy setting to configure:
        - ComputerConfiguration/Policies/WindowsSettings/SecuritySettings/RestrictedGroups
        - Add a group: *BUILTIN\Event Log Readers*
        - Add Members: *DOMAIN\Arcsight*, *NT AUTHORITY\NETWORK SERVICE*
      - Update01: Upon further testing, it appears to work without the NETWORK SERVICE user. I will try without both to confirm
      - Update02: After removing both user from the Event Log Readers group, I was not able to continue with the SmartConnector setup. But after I added just the arcsight user back, it worked. I don't think I need the NETWORK SERVICE user in the group
        

    - *TEST01*: Reverted Wevtutil security to disallow network service. (Removed (A;;0X1;;;S-1-5-0) )
      - *RESULT*: After removing the security modificaiton, I was still able to receive logs. So I am fairly sure the only 'necessity' is for the user configured in the SmartConnector to be a member of the EventLog Readers BUILTIN group for each machine

   2) Leave the WEF Source Hosts file blank
      - [[file:./.connectors-05.png]]
   3) The rest is normal Smartconnector setup
